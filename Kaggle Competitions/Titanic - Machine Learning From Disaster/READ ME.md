### Goal
The primary goal of the code is to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not, based on various attributes like age, sex, passenger class, etc.

### Workflow
1. **Data Loading and Initial Setup**: 
    - Libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, and `sklearn` are imported for handling data, visualization, and applying machine learning algorithms.
    - The Titanic dataset is divided into training (`train.csv`) and test (`test.csv`) sets.

2. **Data Preprocessing and Outlier Detection**: 
    - Outliers are detected and removed using the Tukey method.
    - Information about the dataset (like counts, means, etc.) is displayed for initial analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Basic analysis through `.info()` and `.describe()` functions to understand data distribution and missing values.
    - Correlation analysis to understand the relationship between different features and survival.
    - Pivot tables and visualizations (using seaborn and matplotlib) are created to analyze relationships between features like `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Embarked`, `SibSp`, and `Parch`, and the target variable `Survived`.

4. **Feature Engineering and Data Cleaning**:
    - Irrelevant features like `Cabin`, `PassengerId`, `Name`, and `Ticket` are dropped.
    - Missing values are handled, and categorical variables are converted into numerical ones using `LabelEncoder`.
    - New features like `Family Size` and `Alone` are created and analyzed.
    - Age and Fare features are binned into categorical variables for better model performance.

5. **Model Development**:
    - The dataset is split into features (`X`) and target (`y`).
    - Different machine learning models like Logistic Regression, SVC, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are trained and validated on the training set.
    - The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy as the metric.

6. **Final Prediction and Submission**:
    - The Random Forest model is used to make final predictions on the test set.
    - Predictions are prepared for submission in the required format.
